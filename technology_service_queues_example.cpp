/*
 * Analysis Answers
 *
 * B4 — Circular queue state
 * After LT-101 and LT-102 are checked out, why can LT-105 use an array position
 * near the beginning even though LT-103 and LT-104 are still available? Explain
 * the roles of frontIndex, rearIndex, and itemCount.
 * Answer:
 * After the two checkouts, frontIndex moved to 2, so the queue starts at LT-103.
 * Positions 0 and 1 are free now because the queue only counts itemCount devices
 * starting from frontIndex. rearIndex was 3 (LT-104), so when LT-105 arrives
 * it becomes (3 + 1) % 4 = 0, and LT-105 goes into the free position 0 without
 * moving LT-103 and LT-104. frontIndex tells which device leaves next, rearIndex
 * tells where the last returned device is, and itemCount tells how many devices are
 * really in the queue. itemCount is needed because frontIndex and rearIndex can look
 * the same when the queue is empty and when it is full.
 *
 * B5 — Dynamic queue empty state
 * After SR-231 is handled, why must rear become nullptr as well as front? Explain
 * what would be wrong if rear still pointed to the deleted node before SR-245 arrives.
 * Answer:
 * When SR-231 is removed, front becomes nullptr because there is no next node.
 * If rear stayed the same, it would point to SR-231, a node that was already deleted.
 * Then enqueue("SR-245") would see that rear is not nullptr, so it would think the
 * queue has nodes, and it would do rear->next = newNode on deleted memory. That is
 * undefined behavior, and front would still be nullptr, so SR-245 would never
 * be found. That is why both front and rear must be nullptr when the queue is empty.
