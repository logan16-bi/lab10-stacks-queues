/*
 * Analysis Answers
 *
 * B4 — Circular queue state
 * After LT-101 and LT-102 are checked out, why can LT-105 use an array position
 * near the beginning even though LT-103 and LT-104 are still available? Explain
 * the roles of frontIndex, rearIndex, and itemCount.
 * Answer:
 * The queue only counts the devices between the front and the rear, so once LT-101
 * and LT-102 leave, their positions are free again. When LT-105 comes in, rearIndex
 * goes past the last position and wraps back to the beginning, so it uses one of the
 * free spots. frontIndex shows which device leaves next, rearIndex shows where the
 * newest device is, and itemCount keeps track of how many devices are in the queue
 * so the program can tell if it is empty or full.
 *
 * B5 — Dynamic queue empty state
 * After SR-231 is handled, why must rear become nullptr as well as front? Explain
 * what would be wrong if rear still pointed to the deleted node before SR-245 arrives.
 * Answer:
 * When the last request is handled, front becomes nullptr, and rear has to become
 * nullptr too. If rear kept pointing to the deleted node, it would be pointing to
 * memory that no longer belongs to the queue. Then when SR-245 arrives, enqueue
 * would think there is still a last node and try to attach the new one to it, which
 * breaks the queue.
